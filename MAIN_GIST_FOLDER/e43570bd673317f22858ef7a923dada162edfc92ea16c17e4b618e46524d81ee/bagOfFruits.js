 Our fruit guy has a bag of fruits (array of strings) where some 
 fruits are rotten, he wants to replace all the rotten fruits by 
 good ones. For example, given this array ["apple","rottenBanana","apple"] 
 the replaced array should be ["apple","banana","apple"]. Your task is to 
 implement a method that will take as an argument an array of strings 
 containing fruits and should return an array of strings where all the 
 rotten fruits are replaced by good ones.

function removeRotten(bagOfFruits){
  const newBagOfFruits = []; 
  
  if (bagOfFruits == null) {
    return []; 
  }
  
  bagOfFruits.map(item => {
    newBagOfFruits.push(item.replace(/rotten/i, '').toLowerCase()); 
  });
  
  return newBagOfFruits; 
}
