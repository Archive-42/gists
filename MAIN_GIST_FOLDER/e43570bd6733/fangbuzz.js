 Make a program that takes input and returns "Fizz" if it is a multiple of 7, 
 "Fang" if it is a mulitple of 49 AND 3, "Foo" if it is a multiple of 15, and 
 "Far" if it is not divisible by any of those.

 Note: Your program should only give one output. Note: When you are making your 
 code you should check the divisibility such that it checks 49 and 3 first then 7 
 then 15. Check the example test codes for examples of the outputs and inputs.
