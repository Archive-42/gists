Obviously it gets more complicated than that:

1. You can manage libraries that weren't built with require.js in mind.
2. You can compile all of your modules down to a single file using r.js (I compile them down to require.js itself because the html is already including it :). Saw someone do that and it works nicely. Just maintain a require.js.tmpl or something to go back to "development" mode).
3. There are many more configuration options.
4. require.js has a plugin system that I haven't used much, but can be used to include things like ascii templates that aren't evaluated as scripts, but passed in as arguments just the same.

But this should be a good jumping-off point.
