    <h1 id="hiring-without-whiteboards">Hiring Without Whiteboards</h1>
    <p>
      A list of companies (or teams) that don‚Äôt do ‚Äúwhiteboard‚Äù interviews.
      ‚ÄúWhiteboards‚Äù is used as a metaphor, and is a <em>symbol</em> for the
      kinds of CS trivia questions that are associated with bad interview
      practices. Whiteboards are not bad ‚Äì CS trivia questions are. Using sites
      like HackerRank/LeetCode <em>probably</em> fall into a similar category.
    </p>
    <p>
      The companies and teams listed here use interview techniques and questions
      that resemble day-to-day work. For example, pairing on a real world
      problem or a paid/unpaid take home exercise. Read (and contribute to)
      <a href="RECOMMENDATIONS.md">our recommendations</a> for ways to conduct
      better interviews.
    </p>
    <h3 id="tldr">tl;dr</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Discussing a real world problem (with or without whiteboard) is üëç
      </li>
      <li>
        Solving CS trivia, technical puzzles, riddles, brainteasers (with or
        without whiteboard) is üëé
