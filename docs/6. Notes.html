    <p>Obviously it gets more complicated than that:</p>
    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        You can manage libraries that weren’t built with require.js in mind.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can compile all of your modules down to a single file using r.js (I
        compile them down to require.js itself because the html is already
        including it :). Saw someone do that and it works nicely. Just maintain
        a require.js.tmpl or something to go back to “development” mode).
      </li>
      <li>There are many more configuration options.</li>
      <li>
        require.js has a plugin system that I haven’t used much, but can be used
        to include things like ascii templates that aren’t evaluated as scripts,
        but passed in as arguments just the same.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>But this should be a good jumping-off point.</p>
