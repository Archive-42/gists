      You will install three pieces of software so that you can start using
      PostgreSQL. You will install PostgreSQL itself on your Windows
      installation. Then, you will install <code>psql</code> in your Ubuntu
      installation. Then you will also install Postbird, a cross-platform
      graphical user interface that makes working with SQL and PostgreSQL better
      than just using the command line tool <code>psql</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you read “installation”, that means the actual OS that’s running on
      your machine. So, you have a Windows installation, Windows 10, that’s
      running when you boot your computer. Then, when you start the Ubuntu
      installation, it’s as if there’s a completely separate computer running
      inside your computer. It’s like having two completely different laptops.

    <p>
      To install PostgreSQL 12, you need to download the installer from the
      Internet. PostgreSQL’s commercial company, Enterprise DB, offers
      installers for PostgreSQL for every major platform.

      Installing PostgreSQL Client Tools on Ubuntu
    </h2>
    <p>
      Now, to install the PostgreSQL Client tools for Ubuntu. You need to do
      this so that the Node.js (and later Python) programs running on your
      Ubuntu installation can access the PostgreSQL server running on your
      Windows installation. You need to tell <code>apt</code>, the package
      manager, that you want it to go find the PostgreSQL 12 client tools from
      PostgreSQL itself rather than the common package repositories. You do that
      by issuing the following two commands. Copy and paste them one at a time
      into your shell. (If your Ubuntu shell isn’t running, start one.)
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Pro-tip</strong>: Copy those commands because you’re not going to
      type them, right? After you copy one of them, you can just right-click on
      the Ubuntu shell. That should paste them in there for you.
    </p>
    <pre><code>wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -</code></pre>
    <p>If prompted for your password, type it.</p>
    <pre><code>echo &quot;deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ `lsb_release -cs`-pgdg main&quot; | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list</code></pre>
    <p>
      The last line of output of those two commands running should read “OK”. If
      it does not, try copying and pasting them one at a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you’ve registered the PostgreSQL repositories as a source to look
      for PostgreSQL, you need to update the <code>apt</code> registry. You
      should do this before you install <em>any</em> software on Ubuntu.
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt update</code></pre>
    <p>
      Once that’s finished running, the new entries for PostgreSQL 12 should be
      in the repository. Now, you can install them with the following command.
    </p>
    <pre><code>sudo apt install postgresql-client-12 postgresql-common</code></pre>
    <p>If it asks you if you want to install them, please tell it “Y”.</p>
    <p>
      Test that it installed by typing <code>psql --version</code>. You should
      see it print out information about the version of the installed tools. If
      it tells you that it can’t find the command, try these instructions over.
    </p>
    <h2 id="configuring-the-client-tools">Configuring the client tools</h2>
    <p>
      Since you’re going to be accessing the PosgreSQL installation from your
      Ubuntu installation on your Windows installation, you’re going to have to
      type that you want to access it over and over, which means extra typing.
      To prevent you from having to do this, you can customize your shell to
      always add the extra commands for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      This assumes you’re still using Bash. If you changed the shell that your
      Ubuntu installation uses, please follow that shell’s directions for adding
      an alias to its startup file.
    </p>
    <p>
      Make sure you’re in your Ubuntu home directory. You can do that by typing
      <code>cd</code> and hitting enter. Use <code>ls</code> to find out if you
      have a <code>.bashrc</code> file. Type <code>ls .bashrc</code>. If it
      shows you that one exists, that’s the one you will add the alias to. If it
      tells you that there is no file named that, then type
      <code>ls .profile</code>. If it shows you that one exists, that’s the one
      you will add the alias to. If it shows you that it does not exist, then
      use the file name <code>.bashrc</code> in the following section.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that you know which profile file to use, type
      <code>code «profile file name»</code> where “profile file name” is the
      name of the file you determined from the last section. Once Visual Studio
      Code starts up with your file, at the end of it (or if you’ve already
      added aliases, in that section), type the following.
    </p>
    <pre><code>alias psql=&quot;psql -h localhost&quot;</code></pre>
    <p>
      When you run <code>psql</code> from the command line, it will now always
      add the part about wanting to connect to <em>localhost</em> every time.
      You would have to type that each time, otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make sure that you set that up correctly, type
      <code>psql -U postgres postgres</code>. This tells the
      <code>psql</code> client that you want to connect as the user “postgres”
      (<code>-U postgres</code>) to the database postgres (<code>postgres</code>
      at the end), which is the default database created when PostgreSQL is
      installed. It will prompt you for a password. Type the password that you
      used when you installed PostgrSQL, earlier. If the alias works correctly
      and you type the correct password, then you should see something like the
      following output.
    </p>
    <pre><code>psql (12.2 (Ubuntu 12.2-2.pgdg18.04+1))
Type &quot;help&quot; for help.

postgres=#</code></pre>
    <p>
      Type <code>\q</code> and hit Enter to exit the PostgreSQL client tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, you will add a user for your Ubuntu identity so that you don’t have
      to specify it all the time. Then, you will create a file that PostgreSQL
      will use to automatically send your password every time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Copy and paste the following into your Ubuntu shell. Think of a password
      that you want to use for your user.
      <strong
        >Replace the password in the single quotes in the command with the
        password that you want.</strong
      >
      It <em>has</em> to be a non-empty string. PostgreSQL doesn’t like it when
      it’s not.
    </p>
    <pre><code>psql -U postgres -c &quot;CREATE USER `whoami` WITH PASSWORD &#39;password&#39; SUPERUSER&quot;</code></pre>
    <p>
      It should prompt you for a password. Type the password that you created
      when you installed PostgreSQL. Once you type the correct password, you
      should see “CREATE ROLE”.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you will create your PostgreSQL password file. Type the following into
      your Ubuntu shell to open Visual Studio Code and create a new file.
    </p>
    <pre><code>code ~/.pgpass</code></pre>
    <p>
      In that file, you will add this line, which tells it that on localhost for
      port 5432 (where PostgreSQL is running), for all databases (*),
      <strong
        >use your Ubuntu user name and the password that you just created for
        that user with the <code>psql</code> command you just typed.</strong
      >
      (If you have forgotten your Ubuntu user name, type <code>whoami</code> on
      the command line.) Your entry in the file should have this format.
    </p>
    <pre><code>localhost:5432:*:«your Ubuntu user name»:«the password you just used»</code></pre>
    <p>
      For the curriculum writers’ systems, it looks like this in Visual Studio
      Code.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img
        src="https://appacademy-open-assets.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/Module-SQL/assets/windows-pgpass-configuration.png"
        alt="pgpass file"
      />
      <figcaption>pgpass file</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Once you have that information in the file, save it, and close Visual
      Studio Code.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last step you have to take is change the permission on that file so
      that it is only readable by your user. PostgreSQL will ignore it if just
      anyone can read and write to it. This is for <em>your</em> security.
      Change the file permissions so only you can read and write to it. You did
      this once upon a time. Here’s the command.
    </p>
    <pre><code>chmod go-rw ~/.pgpass</code></pre>
    <p>
      You can confirm that only you have read/write permission by typing
      <code>ls -al ~/.pgpass</code>. That should return output that looks like
      this, <strong>with your Ubuntu user name instead of “appacademy”.</strong>
    </p>
    <pre><code>-rw------- 1 appacademy appacademy 37 Mar 28 21:20 /home/appacademy/.pgpass</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now, try connecting to PostreSQL by typing <code>psql postgres</code>.
      Because you added the alias to your startup script, and because you
      created your <strong>.pgpass</strong> file, it should now connect without
      prompting you for any credentials! Type <code>\q</code> and press Enter to
      exit the PostgreSQL command line client.
    </p>
    <h2 id="installing-postbird">Installing Postbird</h2>
    <p>
      Head over to the
      <a href="https://github.com/Paxa/postbird/releases"
        >Postbird releases page on GitHub</a
      >. Click the installer for Windows which you can recognize because it’s
      the only file in the list that ends with “.exe”.

      <figcaption>Download Postbird</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      After that installer downloads, run it. You will get a warning from
      Windows that this is from an unidentified developer. If you don’t want to
      install this, find a PostgreSQL GUI client that you do trust and install
      it or do everything from the command line.

      You should get used to seeing this because many open-source applications
      aren’t signed with the Microsoft Store for monetary and philosophical
      reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otherwise, if you trust Paxa like App Academy and tens of thousands of
      other developers do, then click the link that reads “More info” and the
      “Run anyway” button.

      />
      <figcaption>Postbird run anyway</figcaption>

    <p>
      When it’s done installing, it will launch itself. Test it out by typing
      the “postgres” into the “Username” field and the password from your
      installation in the “Password” field. Click the Connect button. It should
      properly connect to the running

      You can close it for now. It also installed an icon on your desktop. You
      can launch it from there or your Start Menu at any time.

    <h2 id="what-you-did">What you did</h2>
    <p>
      You installed and configured PosgreSQL 12, a relational database
