Rule Description

---

[**S**ingle responsibility A module should be responsible to
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_responsibility_principle) one, and only one, actor.

[**O**pen/closed A software artifact should be open
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open/closed_principle) for extension but closed for
modification.

[**L**iskov substitution It should be possible to substitute
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle) base class with derived class.

[**I**nterface segregation Many client-specific interfaces are
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interface_segregation_principle) better than one general-purpose
interface.

[**D**ependency inversion Depend upon Abstractions but not on
principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_inversion_principle) concretions. This means that each
module should be separated from
other using an abstract layer which
binds them together. Source code
dependency points in the opposite
direction compared to the flow of
control.

  algorithm?

- What is [_sequential
  consistency_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_consistency)?

  relationship, it is said to contain a data race. Two accesses to
  (reads of or writes to) the same variable are said to be conflicting
  if at least one of the accesses is a write. But see
  [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16615140/is-volatile-read-happens-before-volatile-write/16615355#16615355))
- Java [_memory
  model_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se12/html/jls-17.html#jls-17.4)

    sequentially consistent executions are free of data races
  - Correctly synchronized programs have sequentially consistent
    semantics. If a program is correctly synchronized, then all
    executions of the program will appear to be sequentially
    consistent
  - Causality requirement for incorrectly synchronized programs:

- _Data race_. When an evaluation of an expression writes to a memory
  location and another evaluation reads or modifies the same memory
  location, the expressions are said to conflict. A program that has
  two conflicting evaluations has a data race unless

  - both evaluations execute on the same thread or in the same
    signal handler, or
  - both conflicting evaluations are atomic operations (see
    std::atomic), or
  - one of the conflicting evaluations happens-before another (see
    std::memory_order)

  If a data race occurs, the behavior of the program is undefined.
