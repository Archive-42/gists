[]{#chapter1} Chapter 1 - Good Parts
------------------------------------

> parts and avoiding the bad parts. After all, how can you build
> something good out of bad parts?

The best parts of Javascript include: \* functions \* loose typing
(variables are declared as variables, without a type) \* dynamic objects
\* object literal notation (where you can create an object already with
a list of key/value pairs inside curly braces)

The worst parts include global variables - there is a common *global
object* namespace where they're all lumped together and they're
essential to the language.

Javascript has a *class free* object makeup, relying instead on objects
inheriting properties directly from other objects - this is **prototypal
inheritance**.

[]{#chapter2} Chapter 2 - Grammar
---------------------------------

Always use // for comments, even multi-line ones to avoid having to
escape `/*` characters.

### Numbers

-   There is a single, 64-bit floating point number type.
-   `NaN` (Not-a-Number) is not equal to any value (including itself)
    and is essentially an **illegal number value**, but
    *typeOf(NaN)===number is true*
-   Use `isNaN(number)` to check for NaNs

Number methods are discussed in [Chapter 8](#chapter8).

### Strings

-   16-bit character set and don't have character types.
-   Backslashes (\\) are used for **escaping characters** that could
    cause problems in strings.
-   Strings are **immutable**.

Single quotes are often used to define a String in JavaScript, but if a
person's name has an apostrophe (and the developer does not know the
difference between an apostrophe and single quote) it is useful to
"escape" the apostrophe character:

::: {#cb1 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var name = 'Patrick O\'Brian'; // using a backslash in front of the apostrophe
console.log('name:', name); // name: Patrick O'Brian
```

![BackSlashExample](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/25989405/e47ff6aa-36f3-11e7-9e3d-c7a3da6f1872.png "Backslash Example")

String methods are discussed in [Chapter 8](#chapter8).

### Statements

-   *Inside* a function, the var statement creates variables local to
    that function
-   *switch, while, for* and *do* statements can have an optional
    **label** which can be used with `break` and `continue` to provide
    more precise [control over exactly which statement to break or
    continue](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/cgi-bin/practice.cgi?file=javascript_19).
    Format: `labelname: statement` and then `continue labelname;`
-   ES2015 presents two new keywords for declaring variables, *let* and
    *const*. Whereas the *var* keyword is function scoped (the variables
    are local to the function), *let* and *const* are both block scoped,
    which means they are local to any statement with {}.
-   *falsy* values:
    -   false
    -   null
    -   undefined
    -   Empty string ' '
    -   The number 0
    -   The number NaN
-   All other values are *truthy* including all objects & the string
    'false'
-   If no matches are found in `case` statements, the optional default
    statement is executed, otherwise the matching case statement is
    carried out
-   When using a *for in* loop, usually a good idea to use
    `hasOwnProperty(variable)` to **make sure the property belongs to
    the object you want** and is not instead an inherited property from
    the prototype chain:

::: {#cb2 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
for (myvariable in object) {
        if (object.hasOwnProperty(myvariable)) {
        ... //statements to be executed
        }
}
```
:::

-   A *do while* statement is always executed at least once as the while
    condition is only checked after the first iteration of the loop
-   `catch` clause in a *try* statement **must create a new variable**
    that will catch the exception object
-   Scope of `throw` statement is the `try` block it's in, or the `try`
    of the function it's in
-   If there is no `return` statement, `return===undefined`
-   `break` exits the statement and `continue` forces a new iteration of
    the loop, both with the optional *label* mentioned above

### Expressions

-   For `expression ? expression2 : expression3`, if expression is
    *truthy*, execute expresion2; if it's *falsy*, execute expression3
-   *Invocation* is `(expression1, expression2, etc)`
-   *refinement* is either `.name` or `[expression]` as used in an array

### Literals

-   *Names* or *strings* used for specifying new objects ([**object
    literals**](#chapter3)) or arrays ([**array literals**](#chapter6))
-   Properties of the object are expressions and must be known at
    compile time

### Functions

-   A function literal defines a function value
-   More details in [Chapter 4](#chapter4)

[]{#chapter3} Chapter 3 - Objects
---------------------------------

Javascript simple types: \* numbers *(has object-like methods but they
are immutable)* \* strings *(has object-like methods but they are
immutable)* \* booleans *(has object-like methods but they are
immutable)* \* null \* undefined

**All other values are *objects*** including arrays and functions.

Objects are **class free**, can contain other objects and can inherit
properties from their prototypes (which can *reduce object
initialisation time and memory consumption*).

### Object Literals

-   An object literal is *zero or more comma-separated name/value pairs
    surrounded by curly braces* {}

::: {#cb3 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var empty_object = {};

var today = {
    day: "Wednesday",
    month: "April",
    year: 2014,

    weather: { //objects can contain nested objects like this one
        morning: "sunny",
        afternoon: "cloudy"
    }
}
```
:::

### Retrieval

-   Can be done with either dot notation `today.weather.morning` or with
    square brackets `today['month']`
-   Or operand (\|\|) can be used to fill in default values for
    nonexistent data to prevent and *undefined* error:
    `var weath = today.weather.evening || "unknown"`

### Update

-   Assigning a property value to an object **overwrites** any existing
    property values with that property name

### Reference

-   Objects refer to each other, they don't hold duplicate copies of
    data

### Prototype

-   Every object has a prototype object from which it inherits
    properties
-   *Object.prototype* comes standard with Javascript and is almost like
    a 'root parent' ![Object prototype
    diagram](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1NdiIkHd9Cg2j6W4QcJ1X3DEhGXD2gacMXRuURcoE5T4/pub?w=960&h=720 "Object prototype diagram from @sporto")
-   The `Object.create` method is now available in ES5 (but the method
    is in the book if required for older versions)
-   If an object does not have a property you ask it for, it will **keep
    looking up the prototype chain until it finds it**
    -   If the property *does note exist* anywhere in the chain, it will
        return *undefined*
-   A new property is *immediately visible* to all of the objects below
    it in the chain once created

More details in [Chapter 6](#chapter6)

### Reflection

-   Determining what properties an object has
-   Using `typeof` **includes all properties in the prototype chain**
    including functions
-   To avoid inherited properties, use `hasOwnProperty(type);` which
    returns *true* if that property exists only in that object itself
    (not the chain)

::: {#cb4 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
today.hasOwnProperty('number')  //will return true
today.hasOwnProperty('constructor')   //will return false
```
:::

### Enumeration

-   Best way to enumerate all the properties you want is a for loop:

::: {#cb5 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var i;
var properties = [
    'day', 'month', 'year'
    ];
for (i = 0; i < properties.length; i++) {
    document.writeIn(properties[i] + ':' + today[properties[i]]);
}
```
:::

-   This ensures you get the **properties you want** (i.e.Â not up the
    prototype chain) and in the **order you want**, as opposed to a *for
    in* loop which achieves neither of these

### Delete

-   Removes property from object, but also **reveals property from
    further up the prototype chain** if it exists
-   Format: `delete today.month`

### Global Abatement

-   One way to mitigate the risks of global variables is to *create a
    single global variable* which then contains your whole application

::: {#cb6 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var MYAPP = {}

MYAPP.today = {
    day: "Wednesday",
    month: "April",
    year: 2014,

    weather: { //objects can contain nested objects like this one
        morning: "sunny",
        afternoon: "cloudy"
    }
}
//Making sure all other variables (like today) are contained within this one global variable (MYAPP) means none of them have global scope and therefore the risk of naming conflicts, etc in your application is reduced
```
:::

-   [Closures](#chapter4) are also a way of mitigating the risks of
    global variables
-   Note: **Most [Javascript
    MVCs](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2012/07/27/journey-through-the-javascript-mvc-jungle/)
    these days (2014) will take care of wrapping your app for you**

[]{#chapter4} Chapter 4 - Functions
-----------------------------------

> The best thing about JavaScript is its implementation of functions.

### Function Objects

-   Functions are objects linked to *function.prototype* (which is
    linked to *Object.prototype*).
-   As well as usual object behaviour, they can be **invoked**.

### Function Literal

-   A function literal has 4 parts:
    -   The (reserved) word `function` itself
    -   An *optional* name (un-named functions are considered
        *anonymous* functions)
    -   Comma-seperated parameters of the function, in parentheses -
        `(parameters)`
    -   Set of statements in curly brackets to be carried out when the
        function is invoked - `{statements}`

::: {#cb7 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//Format of a function
function name (parameterA, parameterB){
    statements;
}
```
:::

[]{#nestedFunctions} \* Functions can be nested within functions and the
inner function can access all the parameters of the outer function as
well as its own

### Invocation

-   Stops the current function from running and tells the function you
    have invoked both to start and to use the arguments (values in
    parentheses) you have passed it in the invocation
    `function (parameters)`
    -   If arguments \> number of arguments expected, the **extra values
        will be ignored**
    -   If arguments \< number of arguments expected, the function will
        assume **undefined in place of the missing arguments**
    -   No error is thrown
-   **Note:** The difference between an *argument* and a *parameter* is
    that a parameter is usually what is used in the function literal,
    when you're setting up the function (almost like the placeholder for
    the actual values that the function will use when it is active) and
    an argument is usually the value passed to a function at the time it
    is invoked
-   Parameters `this` and `arguments` are also passed to the function
    when it is invoked, but their value depends on how the function is
    invoked

#### Method Invocation Pattern

-   When a function is **stored as the property of the object** (invoked
    with a dot . expression) it is called on and is called a *method*

::: {#cb8 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
myObject.incrementFunction();
```
:::

-   The method is **bound to the object** and therefore can use `this`
    to **retrieve or update values from the object**
-   These methods are **highly reusable**
-   Because their *object context* comes from `this` they are considered
    *public methods*

#### Function Invocation Pattern

-   When a function is *not* the property of an object, it is invoked as
    a *function*

::: {#cb9 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var sum = add(3, 4);
```
:::

-   These functions are **bound to the global object** (*a "mistake in
    the design of the language" according to Douglas Crockford)* and
    consequently so is `this`[even in inner functions](#nestedFunctions)
-   Invoking `this` within an inner function will therefore refer to its
    *own* `this` and **not** the one in global scope

**Workaround:** Artificially create a new `this`:

::: {#cb10 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
myObject.double = function() {
    //in the book, the var here is called `that` but name changed for clarity
    var globalScopeThis = this; //workaround

    var innerFunc = function() {
        globalScopeThis.value = add(globalScopeThis.value, globalScopeThis.value);
    };

    innerFunc(); //invoke innerFunc as function
};

myObject.double();
console.log(myObject.value);
```
:::

#### Constructor Invocation Pattern

-   When a function is created with `new`, that function contains a link
    to the function's prototype
-   This means that methods that were created for the **prototype
    function are also available** to the function created using `new`

::: {#cb11 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//create a function Quo that takes a string - Quo will be our prototype function as we will see
var Quo = function (string){
    this.status = string;
}

//Now create a get_status method for Quo - this will be a public method
Quo.prototype.get_status = function () {
    return this.status;
}

//create a new instance of Quo using the prefix NEW
var myQuo = new Quo("happy");

//because of the use of the new prefix, myQuo is an instance of Quo which means it can access the public method get_status from it's prototype
document.writeIn(myQuo.get_status());     //returns 'happy'
```
:::

-   **This style of constructor pattern is not recommended**, there will
    be better examples in [Chapter 5](#chapter5) - this is noted again
    in [Appendix B](#new)
-   The first letter of a constructor function (in this case Quo) **must
    *always* be capitalized**

#### Apply Invocation Pattern

-   The `apply` method lets you **choose the value to be bound to
    `this`**
-   It also takes the parameters for a function in an array
-   Format:
    `function.apply(valueForThis, arrayOfParamentersForFunction);`

::: {#cb12 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var array = [5, 2]    //will be the parameters for our function
var sum = add.apply(null, array);     //value of 'this' is null and value of sum is 7 as the 'apply' method passes 5 and 2 to the 'add' method
```
:::

### Arguments

-   Another default parameter of functions is the `arguments` array
    which contains all the arguments that were supplied when the
    function was invoked
-   This means you don't have to know the exact number of arguments when
    you build a function because you can loop through all the arguments
    provided at invocation with the use of the default `arguments` array

::: {#cb13 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//inside the function
for (i = 0; i < arguments.length; i++) {
    dosomething;  //e.g. sum +=arguments[i]
}
```
:::

-   `arguments` **lacks all the array methods except .length** because
    of a bug

### Return

-   When a function gets to a `return` statement, it returns immediately
    **without carrying out the remaining statements in the function**
-   A function **always returns a `value`** or if unspecified, it
    returns `undefined`
-   "If the function was invoked with the `new` prefix (used when
    creating a new object so it **must** return an object) and the
    `return` value is not an object, then `this` (the new object) is
    returned instead."

### Exceptions

-   A `throw` statement interrupts the execution of the code is used to
    handle expected exceptions like an incorrect type of argument
    (e.g.Â a string where a number is expected)
-   Each `throw` statement should have an **exception object** with a
    `name` holding the type of exception and a `message` with an
    explanation of it + any other properties you like

::: {#cb14 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//Thinking through what exceptions could happen in an add function, the main function contains the throw statement with the exception object
var add = function (a,b) {
    if (typeof a !== 'number' || typeof b !== 'number'){
        throw {
            name: 'TypeError';
            message: 'The add function requires numbers';
        }
    }
    return a + b;
}
```
:::

-   When you write a function to use *add()*, you include a `try` block
    where the exception object from the `throw` statement in *add()*
    will pass control to a **single catch clause for all exceptions**

::: {#cb15 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//When you use the function later on, add a try block with a catch clause to catch the exception object
var try_it = function () {
    try{
        add("seven");   //will throw an exception as it is not a number
    }
    catch (e) {
        document.writeIn(e.name + ':' + e.message);
    }
}

try_it();    //you could rewrite this function so the argument is passed in here where it is invoked
```
:::

### Augmenting Types

-   Adding a method to the prototype of an object `Object.prototype` (or
    function, array, string, number, regular expression or boolean), you
    make it available to all the instances of that object so you don't
    have to use the `prototype` property again
-   By augmenting the *basic types* (essentially the root prototypes),
    we can improve Javascript overall
-   For example, adding a method named *trim* to remove spaces from the
    end of strings, available to all String instances in your code:

::: {#cb16 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
String.method ('trim', function () {
    return this.replace(/Ë\s+|\s+$/g, '');     //uses regular expression
});
```
:::

-   To be on the safe side, create a method conditionally, **only when
    you know the method is missing**

::: {#cb17 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//Makes a method available to all functions, ONLY when it definitely does not already exist

Function.prototype.method (methodName, func) {
    if (!this.prototype[methodName]){
        this.prototype[methodName] = func;
        return this;
    }
};
```
:::

-   Remember that ***for in* statements don't work well with
    prototypes**

### Recursion

-   Used when a task can be divided into **simple sub-problems** and a
    function can *call itself repeatedly* to solve them Takes the
    format:

::: {#cb18 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var variable = function functionName (parameters){
    //wrap the statements to be executed and the recursive call in a loop statement so it doesn't recurse forever
    //statements to be executed in the function;
    functionName(arguments);
};

functionName (initialArguments); //initial call to the function
```
:::

-   Javascript **does not have *tail recursion optimization*** and
    therefore does not optimize recursive functions - this also means
    they sometimes fail if they "recurse very deeply"; On a side note,
    *tail call optimization* is now supported in
    [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/7.0/index.html#sec-tail-position-calls)

### Scope

-   A *block* is a set of statements contained in curly brackets {}
-   Javascript **does not have block scope** but **does have function
    scope**
    -   All variables declared *anywhere* within a function are
        **available everywhere in that function** - i.e.Â and inner
        function will have access to the variables of the outer function
        in which it is defined
    -   A variable can be *overwritten* with a new value in an inner
        function and that new value's scope will be just the body of the
        inner function - as soon as you're back out to the outer
        function, the value of that variable will revert to what it was
        before the inner function began its execution
    -   All variable should be **declared at the top of the function
        body**

### Closure

-   Inner functions have **access to the actual parameters of the outer
    functions (not copies)**
-   If an object is created as a result of a function and assigned to
    myObject, myObject continues to share access to the variables in the
    functions that created it (actual variables, not copies)
    -   It has access to *the context in which it was created* - this is
        *closure*
    -   This includes later on, even if *the outer function has
        completed its execution and returned*, when the inner function
        is called, it will still have **access to all the variables it
        had access to at the time it was defined** (i.e.Â the variables
        that were *in context* when the inner function was defined)

### Callbacks

-   A *callback function* is a function passed to another function as a
    parameter and executed in this other function
-   When making a request to a server, use an *asynchronous request* as
    asynchronous functions return immediately, therefore freeing up the
    client
    -   In this example, we pass the callback function to the
        asynchronous request as a parameter so the callback function
        will only be called when a response is available

    ::: {#cb19 .sourceCode}
    ``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
    request = prepare_the_request();
    send_request_asynchronously(request, function(response){     //function being passed in as a parameter
      display(response);
    });
    ```
    :::

### []{#Module} Module

-   A module is a function or object whose contents can be used, but its
    state and implementation are hidden
-   It is essentially using function scope and closures keep the
    variables and functions contained within as private as well as
    binding them to a non-global object - **whilst still being
    accessible**
-   Using the *module pattern* is **widely used and good practice** as
    it promotes information hiding (avoiding naming conflicts, etc) and
    encapsulation
    -   This is a [good article on how to use the module
        pattern](http://css-tricks.com/how-do-you-structure-javascript-the-module-pattern-edition/)
        with examples
-   It can also be used to produce **secure objects** (see [durable
    objects](#DurableObject) below)
    -   Methods contained in the object do not make use of `this` or
        `that` so it becomes impossible to change them from outside of
        the object except in ways explicitly permitted by the methods
        (like passing them a parameter)
    -   The methods can be *replaced* but the secrets of how these
        methods function (like how they generate a number for example)
        can't be revealed because they are not tied to a global object

    ::: {#cb20 .sourceCode}
    ``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
    var Serial_maker = function() {

      //all variables defined in this object are now fixed and hidden from anything outside this function
      //see page 42 of book for full example
    };
    //calls to methods passing them parameters are made here
    ```
    :::

-   **Note:** Whilst Javascript variables are usually lowercase, there
    is some convention around capitalizing the first letter of a Module

### Cascade

-   Some methods return nothing, albeit `undefined`
-   If we alter these methods to **return `this` instead of
    `undefined`**, they return the object which can then be passed to
    the next method, e.g `getElement(myBox).move(350,150)` gets the
    element and then passes is to the *move* function for the next
    action
    -   This enables *cascades*, where you **call many methods on the
        same object in sequence because the object is passed from one
        method to the next** (usually separated by `.` as above)
-   Cascades also stop you from trying to do too much in one method and
    makes your code more descriptive

### Curry

-   A `curry` method allows you to *partially evaluate* an existing
    function
    -   An example is below where the function *expects **two**
        arguments*, but it is first invoked with only **one** (in this
        case using `curry` as in `add.curry(10);`) and then later passed
        the second argument
-   It can also be explained as transforming a function that takes
    multiple arguments (`add(a,b)`) into a chain of functions that take
    a single argument each (`addA = add(A); addA(B);` where the two
    functions are now `add()` & `addA()`)

::: {#cb21 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//set up a simple function that we will customise with curry
var add = function (a,b){
    return a + b;
}

var addTen = add.curry(10);      //passes 10 as the first argument to the add() function
addTen(20);                     //The use of the curry method in addTen means addTen === add(10, 20);
```
:::

-   Javascript **does not have a `curry` method** natively but this can
    be added to the `Function.protoype`:

::: {#cb22 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
Function.method('curry', function() {
    var slice = Array.prototype.slice,
        args = slice.apply(arguments),
        that = this;
    return function () {
        return that.apply(null, args.concat(slice.apply(arguments)));
    }
});

### Memoization

-   Storing the results of previous operations in objects (such as
    arrays) allows them to be reused **without having to keep
    recalculating the value** - this optimization is called
    *memoization*
    -   Adding an object to store the results *memoizes the function*
-   Particularly useful when a function is **recursive** and uses the
    results of its previous iteration in the current iteration
-   A *memoizer* function can be created to help memoize future
    functions:

::: {#cb23 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var meoizer = function (memo, fundamental) {
    var shell = function (n) {
        var result = memo[n];
        if (typeof result !== 'number') {
            result = fundamental(shell, n);
            memo[n] = result;
        }
        return result;
    }
    return shell;
}
```

[]{#chapter5} Chapter 5 - Inheritance
-------------------------------------

> Javascript is a prototypal language, which means that objects inherit
> directly from other objects

Main benefit of inheritance is **code reuse** - you only have to specify
differences.

Javascript can *mimic* classical inheritance but has a much **richer set
of code reuse patterns** \* This chapter looks at the more
straightforward patterns but it is always best to **keep it simple**

### Pseudoclassical

-   The pseudoclassical code reuse pattern essentially has constructor
    functions (functions invoked using the `new` prefix) work like
    classes to mimic the classical structure
    -   All properties are public
    -   If you forget to use the `new` prefix, `this` is not bound to
        the new object - it is instead bound to the global object and
        you'll be unwittingly altering these instead!
-   There is no need to use it, **there are better code reuse patterns
    in JavaScript**

### Object Specifiers

Rather than: `var myObject = maker (f, l, m, c, s)` which has too many
parameters to remember in the right order, use an *object specifier*:

::: {#cb24 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var myObject = maker ({      //note curly braces
    first: f,
    last: l,
    state: s,
    city: c
    }
;)
```
:::

to contain them. They can now be **listed in any order**

Also useful to pass object specifiers to JSON ([see Appendix E
notes](#AppendixE))

### Prototypal

-   Zero classes, **one object inherits from another**
-   Create an object literal of a useful object and then make an
    instance of it using the format
    `var myObject = Object.create(originalObjectName)`
-   When you then customise the new object (adding properties or methods
    through the dot notation for example), this is *differential
    inheritance*, where you specify the **differences from the original
    object**

### Functional

-   **All properties of an object are visible** (Javascript has no
    classes so there is no such thing as a 'private variable' which can
    only be seen within a class as per other languages)
-   When you use a *function* to create your original object and the
    same with the object instances, you're essentially utilising
    Javascript functional scope to create private properties and methods
    The below is an example of how you would create an original object,
    the `name` and `saying` properties are now completely private and
    only accessible to the `get_name` and `says` method

::: {#cb25 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var mammal = function (spec) {
    var that = {};    //that is a new object which is basically a container of 'secrets' shared to the rest of the inheritance chain

    that.get_name = function () {
        return spec.name;
    };

    that.says = function () {
        return spec.saying || '';  //returns an empty string if no 'saying' argument is passed through the spec object when calling mammal
    };
    return that;     //returns the object that contains the now private properties and methods (under functional scope)
}

var myMammal = mammal({name: 'Herb'});
```
:::

Creating an object 'cat' can now inherit from the `mammal` constructor
and only pay attention to the differences between it and `mammal`:

::: {#cb26 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var cat = function (spec) {
    spec.saying = spec.saying || 'meow';   //if spec.saying doesn't already exists, make it 'meow'
    var that = mammal(spec);      //here the object 'container of secrets' is set up inheriting from mammal already

    //functions and property augmentations happen here

    return that;      //as above
}
```
:::

-   Requires less effort and gives **better encapsulation** and
    **information hiding** than the pseudoclassical pattern, as well as
    **access to super methods** (see page 54 of book for super method
    example)
-   []{#DurableObject} An **object** created using the functional
    pattern *and* making **no use of `this` or `that`** is a *durable
    object* and cannot be compromised by attackers
    -   Briefly also discussed in [Module](#Module) section above
-   If you do want something to have access to the object's private
    properties and methods, you pass it the `that` bundle (i.e.Â your
    'container of secrets')

### Parts

-   An object can be composed out of a set of parts
    -   For example, you can create a function that provides the object
        it is passed with a number of methods (which are defined in this
        function), where each method is a part that is added to the
        object

[]{#chapter6} Chapter 6 - Arrays
--------------------------------

Javascript only has **array-like objects** which are slower than 'real'
arrays.

**Retrieval and updating** of properties works the **same as with an
object *except with integer property names***.

Arrays have their **own literal format** and their own set of methods
([Chapter 8 - Methods](#chapter8)).

### Array Literals

-   An array literal is a **pair of square brackets surrounding zero or
    more comma-seperated values** `[a, b, c, etc]`
    -   The first value will get the property name '0', the second will
        be '1' and so on
-   Javascript allows an array to contain **any mixture of values**

### Length

-   If you add to the array, the `length` property will increase to
    contain the new element - it will not give an error
-   If you set the `.length` to a smaller number than the current length
    of the array, it will **delete any properties with a subscript \>=
    the new `length`**
-   The `push()` method is sometimes useful to add an element to the end
    of an array
    `numbers.push('go') //adds the element 'go' to the end of the numbers           array`

### Delete

-   Elements can be deleted from the array object using `delete` but
    this **leaves a hole in the array**
-   Use `array.splice(keyInArray, howManyElementsToDelete)` which
    changes the keys for the remaining values in the array so there is
    no hole left
    -   May be *slow*

### Enumeration

-   A `for` statement can be used to iterate over all the properties of
    an array (as it is an object)
-   **Do not use `for in`** as it does not iterate through the
    properties in order and sometimes pulls in from further up the
    prototype chain

### Confusion

> The rule is simple: when the property names \[keys\] are small
> sequential integers, you should use an array. Otherwise, use an
> object.

-   Arrays are most useful when property names are integers *but* they
    can also accept strings as property names
-   Javascript doesn't have a good way of telling an object from an
    array as `typeof array === object`
-   To accurately detect arrays, have to define our own function:

::: {#cb27 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var is_array = function (value) {
    return Object.prototype.toString.apply(value) === '[object Array]';
    //apply(value) binds `value` to `this` & returns true if `this` is an array
}
```
:::

### Methods

-   Array methods are stored in `Array.prototype` which can be augmented
    using the format:

::: {#cb28 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//capital A in Array means this refers to the prototype
Array.method('reduce', function (parameters){
    //define variables and function
    //return a value
});
```
:::

-   Remember, **every array inherits and can use the methods you add to
    `Array.prototype`**
-   You can also add methods *directly to an array* because they are
    objects
    -   `myArray.total = function () { //statements to execute; }` adds
        a 'total' function to the array `myArray`
-   **DO NOT USE:** `Object.create()` will create an object - lacking
    the `length` property - not an array.

### Dimensions

-   Using `[]` will create an empty array as they are not initialized in
    JavaScript
-   Accessing a missing element will give you `undefined`
-   If you have an algorithm that relies on the array not being empty
    and not having `undefined` values, you can write a function that
    will prep your array to have a certain number of defined values,
    essentially initializing it with certain values in place
    -   An `Array.dim` function is outlined on page 63 which will allow
        `var myArray = Array.dim(10,0)` to make an array with 10 zeroes
        starting from the first position in the array(0)
-   Javascript only has **one dimensional arrays** but ***can* have
    array of arrays**
-   Two dimensional arrays (matrices) will have to be set up by the
    programmer
    -   page 63 gives a method for this and for explicitly setting cell
        values so as not to have an empty matrix

[]{#chapter7} Chapter 7 - Regular Expressions
---------------------------------------------

> A *regular expression* is the specification of the syntax of a simple
> language

Used with `regexp.exec`, `regexp.test`, `string.match`,
`string.replace`, `string.search` and `string.split` to interact with
string (more in [Chapter 8 - Methods](#chapter8))

Quite convoluted and difficult to read as they **do not allow comments
or whitespace** so a JavaScript regular expression **must be on a single
line**

### An Example

`/Ë(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?(\/{0,3})([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)(?::(\d+))?(?:\/([Ë?#]*))?(?:\?([Ë#]*))?(?:#(.*))?$/`

Breaking it down one portion ([factor](#Factors)) at a time: \* Note
that the string starts and ends with a slash `/` \* `Ë` indicates the
beginning of a string \* `(?:([A-Za-z]+):)?` \* `(?:...)` indicates a
[*noncapturing group*](#Noncapturing), where the '...' is replaced by
the group that you wish to match, but not save to anywhere \* Suffix `?`
indicates the group is optional, so it could or could not exist in the
string - it could even exist more than once \* `()` around the
*(\[A-Za-z\]+)* indicates a [*capturing group*](#Capturing) which is
therefore captured and placed in the `result` array \* They groups are
placed in the array in order, so the first will appear in `result[1]` \*
**Noncapturing groups are preferred to capturing groups** because
capturing groups have a performance penalty (on account of saving to the
result array) \* You can also have **capturing groups *within*
noncapturing groups** such as
[`(?:Bob says: (\w+))`](http://www.rexegg.com/regex-disambiguation.html)
\* `[...]` indicates a character class \* `A-Za-z` is a character class
containing all 26 letters of the alphabet in both upper and lower case
\* Suffix `+` means character class will be matched *one or more times*
\* Suffix `:` is matched literally (so the letters will be followed by a
colon in this case) \* `(\/{0,3})` \* `\/` The backslash `\` *escapes*
the forward slash `/` (which traditionally symbolises the end of the
regular expression literal) and together they indicate that the forward
slash `/` should be matched \* Suffix `{0,3}` means the slash `/` will
be matched between 0 and 3 times \* `([0-9.\-A-Za-z]+)` \* String made
up of one or more (note the `+` at the end denoting possible multiple
occurrences) digits, letters (upper or lower case), full stops (.) or
hyphens (-) \* Note that the hyphen was escaped with a backslash `\-` as
hyphens usually denote a *range* but in this case is a hyphen within the
expression \* `(?::(\d+))?` \* `\d` represents a *digit character* so
this will be a sequence of *one or more* digit characters (as per the
`+`) \* The digit characters will be immediately preceded by a colon `:`
\* `(\d+)` will be the fourth capturing group in this expression, it is
also *optional* (`?`) and inside a non-capturing group `(?:...)` \*
`(?:\/([Ë?#]*))?` \* Another optional group (`?`), beginning with a
literal slash `/` (escaped by the backslash) \* The `Ë` at the beginning
of character class `[Ë?#]` means it includes *all* characters *except* ?
and \# \* This actually leaves the regexp open to attack because too
many characters are included in the character class \* The `*` indicates
the character class will appear *zero or more* times \* `(?:\?([Ë#]*))?`
\* We've seen everything here before: An optional capturing group
starting with a literal `?` (escaped by the backslash) with zero or more
characters that are not \# \* `(?:#(.*))?` \* Final optional group
beginning with a `#` \* `.` matches any character *except a line ending
character* \* `$` represents the end of a string

-   Note: **`Ë` and `$` are important because they anchor the regexp**
    and checks whether the string matched against it contains *only*
    what is in the regexp
    -   If `Ë` and `$` weren't present, it would check that the string
        *contained* the regexp but wouldn't necessarily be only made up
        of this
    -   Using only `Ë` checks the string *starts* with the regexp
    -   Using only `$` checks the string *ends* with the regexp

**Another example** `/Ë-?\d+(?:\.\d*)?(?:e[+\-]?\d+)?$/i;`

Most of this we have seen before but here are the new bits: \* The `i`
at the end means *ignore case* when matching letters \* `-?` means the
minus sign is optional \* `(?:\.\d*)` matches a decimal point followed
by *zero or more* digits (123.6834.4442284 *does not match*) \* Note
this expression only uses *noncapturing* groups

### Construction

3 flags exist in regular expressions: `i` means insensitive - ignore the
character case, `g` means global - to match multiple items and `m` means
multiline - where Ë and \$ can match line-ending characters

Two ways to build a regular expression: 1. *Regular Expression literals*
as per the examples above start and end with a slash `/` \* Here the
flags are appended after the final slash, for example `/i` \* Be
careful: `RegExp` objects made by regular expression literals share a
single instance 2. Use `RegExp` constructor \* The first parameter is
the string to be made into a `RegExp` object, the second is the flag \*
Useful when all information for creating the regular expression is not
available at time of programming \* Backslashes mean something in the
constructor, so these must be doubled and quotes must be escaped

::: {#cb29 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//example creating a regular expression object that matches a JavaScript string

var my_regexp = new RegExp("'(?:\\\\.|[Ë\\\\\\'])*'", 'g');
```
:::

### Elements

#### Regexp Choice

`|` provides a match if any of the sequences provided match.

In `"into".match(/in|int/);`, the *in* will be a match so it doesn't
even look at the *int*.

#### Regexp Sequence

A *regexp sequence* is made up of one or more regexp
[factors](#Factors). If there are no quantifiers after the factor (like
`?`, `*` or `+`), the factor will be **matched one time**.

#### []{#Factors} Regexp Factor

> A *regexp factor* can be a character, a parenthesized group, a
> character class, or an escape sequence.

It's essentially a portion of the full `RegExp`, like what we broke down
the regexp above into.

-   The following special characters must all be *escaped* with a
    backslash `\` to be taken literally, or they will take on an
    alternative meaning: Â / \[ \] ( ) { } ? + \* \| . Ë\$
-   The `\` prefix **does not make letters or digits literal**
-   When unescaped:
    -   `.` matches any character except line-ending
    -   `Ë` matches the beginning of the text when `lastIndex` property
        is zero, or matches line-ending character when the `m` flag is
        present
    -   Having `Ë` inside a [character class](#RegexpClass) means NOT,
        so \[Ë0-9\] means *does not* match a digit
    -   `$` matches the beginning of the text or a line-ending character
        when the `m` flag is present

#### Regexp Escape

As well as escaping special characters in regexp factors, the backslash
has additional uses: \* As in strings, `\f` is the formfeed character,
`\n` is new line, `\r` is carriage return, `\t` is tab and `\u`
specifies Unicode as a 16-bit hex. But **`\b` is *not* a backspace
character** \* `\d` === \[0-9\] and `\D` is the opposite, NOT (Ë) a
digit, \[Ë0-9\] \* `\s` matches is a partial set of Unicode whitespace
characters and `\S` is the opposite \* `\w` === \[0-9A-Za-z\] and `\W`
=== \[Ë0-9A-Za-z\] but **useless for any real world language** (because
of accents on letters, etc) \* `\1` refers to the text captured in group
1 so it is matched again later on in the regexp \* `\2` refers to group
2, `\3` to group 3 and so on

\*`\b` is a *bad part*. It was supposed to be a word-boundary anchor but
is useless for multilingual applications

#### Regexp Group

Four kinds of groups: \* []{#Capturing} **Capturing:** `(...)` where
each group is captured into the `result` array - the first capturing
group in the regexp goes into `result[1]`, the second into `result[2]`
and so on \* []{#Noncapturing} **Noncapturing** `(?:...)` where the text
is matched, but not captured and saved anywhere, making is *slightly
faster* than a capturing group (has no bearing on numbering of capturing
groups) \* *Positive lookahead*, a **bad** part: `(?=...)` acts like a
noncapturing group except after the match is made, it goes back to where
text started \* *Negative lookahead*, a **bad** part: `(?!...)` is like
a positive lookahead but only matches if there is no match with what is
in it

#### []{#RegexpClass} Regexp Class

-   Conveniently and easily specifies one of a set of characters using
    square brackets `[]`, for example vowels: `[aeiou]`
-   Can shorten specification of all 32 ASCII special characters to
    **\[!-/:-@\[-\`{-Ë\]** (note that the \` in this piece of code is a
    back-tick)
-   Also allows `Ë` as the first character after the opening `[` to mean
    *NOT* the characters in the character set

#### Regexp Class Escape

There are ***specific* characters that must be escaped in a character
class**: - / \[ Â  \] Ë

#### Regexp Quantifier

A *quantifier* at the end of a factor indicates how many times the
factor should be matched \* A number in curly braces means the factor
should match that many times, so `/o{3}` matches *ooo* \* Two
comma-seperated numbers in curly braces provide the *range* of times a
factor should match, so `{3,5}` indicates it will match 3, 4 or 5 times
\* *Zero or **one*** times (same thing as saying something is optional)
can be `?` or `{0,1}` \* *Zero or **more*** times can be `*` or `{0,}`
\* *One or **more*** times can be `+` or `{1,}`

**Prefer to use 'zero or more' or 'one or more' matching over the 'zero
or one' matching** - i.e.Â prefer *greedy* matching over *lazy* matching

[]{#chapter8} Chapter 8 - Methods
---------------------------------

### Arrays

#### *array*.concat(*item...*)

Produces **new array** copying the original array with the `items`
appended to it (does not modify the original array like
`array.push(item)` does). If the `item` is an array, its elements are
appended.

#### *array*.join(*separator*)

Creates a string of all the array's elements, separated by the
`separator`. Use an empty string `separator` ('') to join without
separation.

#### *array*.pop()

Removes *last element* of array. Returns `undefined` for empty arrays.

#### *array*.push(*item...*)

**Modifies the *array***, appending `items` onto the end. Returns the
new `length` of the array.

#### *array*.reverse()

*Modifies* the array by **reversing the order of the elements**.

#### *array*.shift()

Removes the *first* element of the array (does not leave a hole in the
array - same effect as using the `.splice(a,b)` method) and returns that
first element.

#### *array*.slice(*start, end*)

Different to `splice`.

'slice' creates a **new array**, copying from the `start` element and
stopping at the element *before* the `end` value given. If no `end` is
given, default is `array.length`.

Negative values for `start` and `end` will have `array.length` added to
them and if `start`\>`end`, it will return an **empty** array.

#### *array*.sort(*comparefn*)

JavaScript has a `sort()` method which was created only to compare
strings and therefore sorts numbers incorrectly (it will sort them as 1,
15, 2, 23, 54 for example). Therefore, we have to write a comparison
function which returns *0* if the two elements you are comparing are
equal, a *positive number* if the first element should come first and a
*negative number* if the second element should come first. Then pass
this comparison function to `sort()` as a parameter to allow it to sort
array elements *intelligently*.

Page 80-82 in the book takes you through various iterations of the
comparison functions - for numbers, simple strings, objects and objects
with multiple keys (for example if you want to sort objects by first
*and* last names). These should be taken from the book when required.

#### *array*.splice(*start, deleteCount, item...*)

Removes elements from the array making sure there are no holes left in
the array. It is most popularly used for deleting elements from an
array.

It removes the `deleteCount` number of elements from the array starting
from the `start` position. If there are `item` parameters passed to it,
it will replace the deleted elements in the array with the `items`.

It returns an **array containing the deleted elements**.

#### *array*.unshift(*item...*)

Works like `push` but adds items **to the front of the array** instead
of the end. Returns the new `length` of the array.

### Function

#### *function*.apply(*thisArg, \[argArray\]*)

The `apply` method invokes a function, passing in the object that will
be bound to `this` and *optional* array of arguments.

### Number

#### *number*.toExponentional(*fractionDigits*)

Converts *number* to a string in **exponential form** (e.g.Â 3.14e+0).
`fractionDigits` (from 0 to 20) gives the number of decimal places.

#### *number*.toFixed(*fractionDigits*)

Converts *number* to a string in **decimal form** (e.g.Â 3.1415927).
`fractionDigits` (from 0 to 20) gives the number of decimal places.

#### *number*.toPrecision(*precision*)

Converts *number* to a string in decimal form (e.g.Â 3.1415927). The
difference from `toFixed` is that `precision` (from 0 to 21) gives the
number of **total digits**.

#### *number*.toString(*radix*)

Converts *number* to a **string**. `radix` is an *optional* parameter
between 2 and 36 and gives the *base*. The default radix is 10.

### Object

#### *object*.hasOwnProperty(*name*)

**Does not look at the property chain**. Returns true if the *object*
contains the property `name`.

### RegExp

#### *regexp*.exec(*string*)

Most powerful (and *slowest*) regexp method.

Checks the `string` against the *regexp* (starting at position 0) and
returns an **array** containing the matches. The *regexp* is set up with
various capturing groups and these determine the elements that go in the
array: \* the 0 element of the array will contain the part of `string`
that matched the *regexp* \* element 1 of the array will contain the
text captured by the first capturing group in *regexp* \* element 2 of
the array will contain the text captured by the second capturing group
in *regexp* and so on \* if the match fails, it returns `null`

If the ***regexp* contains a `g` flag**
(e.g.Â `var regexp =         /[Ë<>]+|<(\/?)([A-Za-z]+)([Ë<>]*)>/g;`),
there is a lot more to look out for: \* Searching begins at
`regexp.lastIndex` (initially zero) \* If a match is found, `lastIndex`
becomes the position of the *first character of the match* \* If **no**
match is found, `lastIndex` is reset to zero \* If searching for
multiple occurrences of a pattern by calling `exec` in a loop, ensure
you *reset `lastIndex`* when exiting the loop and remember `Ë` only
matches *when `lastIndex` is equal to zero*

Example on page 87 of the book is worth reading to improve
understanding.

#### *regexp*.test(*string*)

Simplest (and *fastest*) regexp method.

If *regexp* matches the `string` it returns *true*. Otherwise it returns
*false*. **Do not use the `g` flag with this method**.

### String

#### *string*.charAt(*pos*)

Returns character at position `pos` in the string *starting from 0*. If
`pos` is less than zero or bigger than the string itself it return an
**empty string**.

#### *string*.charCodeAt(*pos*)

Same as `charAt` except it returns the **integer** that represents the
*code point value of the character at position `pos`*. Returns `NaN` if
*string*.length \< `pos` \< 0.

#### *string*.concat(*string...*)

Creates **new string** concatenating various strings. `+` tends to be
used instead of this method (e.g.Â `var cat = 'c'+'a'+'t';`)

#### *string*.indexOf(*searchString, position*)

Searches for `searchString` within *string* starting at position
`position` (an optional parameter). If `position` is not provided,
search starts at the beginning of the *string*. Returns the integer
*position of the first matched character* or *-1* if no match is found.

#### *string*.lastIndexOf(*searchString, position*)

Same as `indexOf` but searches **from the end of the string** instead of
the beginning.

#### *string*.localeCompare(*that*)

Compares *string* to `that` parameter and returns: \* 0 if *string* ===
`that` \* -1 if *string* \< `that`

*NB. 'a' \< 'A', comparison is not just in length.*

#### *string*.match(*regexp*)

Works the same way as `regexp.exec(string)` **if** there is no `g` flag
in the `regexp`.

If there is a `g` flag in teh `regexp`, it produces an array of the
matches **but excludes the capturing groups**

#### *string*.replace(*searchValue, replaceValue*)

Searches for the `searchValue` in *string* and replaces it with the
`replaceValue`.

If `searchValue` is a: \* **string**, only its *first occurrence* will
be replaced with the `replaceValue` \* **regexp with a g flag**, *all
occurrences* will be replaced with the `replaceValue`; otherwise, only
the *first occurrence* will be replaced

If `replaceValue` is a: \* **string**, a `$` value has a special meaning
when used in the `replaceValue` that conveys what to replace - see table
on page 90 for possible variations on `$` \* **function**, it is called
for each match and the *string result of the function* is used as the
replacement text \* string result of the first call will replace capture
group 1 of the *string* and so on

#### *string*.search(*regexp*)

Similar to `.indexOf(string)` but takes a `regexp` instead of a
`string`, returning the **position of the first match** (or -1 if there
is no match). The `g` flag is **ignored**.

#### *string*.slice(*start, end*)

Creates a **new string** by copying the characters from the `start`
position to the character before the `end` position in *string*.

The `end` parameter is *optional* and defaults to *string*.length. If
either parameter is negative, *string*.length is added to it.

#### *string*.split(*separator, limit*)

Creates an **array of strings** by splitting apart *string* at the
points where the `separator` appears (e.g.Â if the separator is '.',
ab.cd' becomes \['ab', 'cd'\]). \* If separator is an *empty string*, an
array of single characters is produced. \* `limit` is *optional* and
determines how many pieces are to be split off from the original
*string*. \* The `separator` can be a `regexp` but \* text from
capturing groups within the regexp will be included in the split -
e.g.Â in `var e = text.split(/\s*(,)\s*/);` the commas (,) will each be
included as a separate element in the resulting array \* some systems
*ignore empty strings* when the `separator` is a `regexp`

#### *string*.substring(*start, end*)

No reason to use, **use `slice` instead**.

#### *string*.toLocaleLowerCase()

Produces a **new string** converted to lower case, *using the rules for
the particular locale* (geography).

#### *string*.toLocaleUpperCase()

Produces a **new string** converted to upper case, *using the rules for
the particular locale* (geography).

#### *string*.toLowerCase()

Produces a **new string** converted to lower case.

#### *string*.toUpperCase()

Produces a **new string** converted to upper case.

#### String.fromCharCode(*char...*)

Produces a **new string** from a series of numbers.
`var a = String.fromCharCode(67, 97, 116); //a === 'Cat'` *NB. You're
calling the prototype here, not replacing 'String' with your own
variable.*

[]{#chapter9} Chapter 9 - Style
-------------------------------

> JavaScripts's loose typing and excessive error tolerance provide
> little compile-time assurance of our programs' quality, so to
> compensate, we should code with strict discipline.

-   We should **avoid** the *bad parts* of JavaScript, but also the
    **useful parts that can be occasionally dangerous** \>the likelihood
    a program will work \[as intended\] is significantly enhanced by our
    ability to read it

-   Must be written in a clear, consistent style, including:
    -   Good use of whitespace
    -   Put at most one statement on a line
    -   If you have to break a statement into 2 or more lines, indent
        the 2nd line onwards (an extra four spaces)
    -   *Always* use blocks (curly braces {}) with structured statements
        like `if` and `while` to avoid confusion on what the statement
        is actually doing
        -   Put the opening brace `{` on the same (first) line as the
            statement to avoid JavaScript's [semicolon
            insertion](#SemicolonInsertion) issues - i.e `if (a) { ...`
    -   Use line comments `//comment` and not block commenting (unless
        you're *commenting out* code)
    -   Declare all your variables at the **beginning of the function**,
        due to JavaScript's functional scope \> I use a single global
        variable to contain an application or library. Every object has
        its own namespace, so it is easy to use objects to organize my
        code. Use of closure provides further information hiding,
        increasing the strength of my modules.

[]{#chapter10} Chapter 10 - Beautiful Features
----------------------------------------------

Each feature you add to something has a lot of different costs
(documentation costs, specification, design, testing and development
costs) and these are often not properly accounted for. \> Features that
offer value to a minority of users impose a cost on all users

> We cope with the complexity of feature-driven design by finding and
> sticking with the good parts. For example, microwaves do a ton of
> different things, but most people just use one setting, the timer and
> the clock. So why not design with just the good parts?

[]{#AppendixA} Appendix A - the Awful Parts
-------------------------------------------

**Need to know what all the pitfalls are with these parts.**

### Global variables

These are variables that are visible throughout the code in any scope.
They can be **changed at any time** by any part of the program which
makes them **unreliable in larger complex programs**. This can also lead
to naming conflicts which can cause your code to fail or you to
accidentally overwrite a global variable.

Defined in three ways: \* Using a `var` statement **outside** of any
function; `var foo = value`; \* By adding a property to the global
object (container of all global variables), such as `window` in
browsers; `window.foo = value;` \* Using a variable without declaring it
with `var`, which makes it an *implied global*; `foo = value`

### Scope

Although JavaScript has block *syntax* (i.e.Â is written in blocks) like
a lot of other programming languages, it has **functional scope** and
*not* block scope.

Variables should all be declared at the top of the function and not
littered throughout the block.

### []{#SemicolonInsertion} Semicolon Insertion

Attempts to correct faulty programs by automatically inserting
semicolons. **Do not depend on this** as it can hide underlying issues.

Also ensure opening curly braces ({) are on the first line of a
statement, otherwise semicolons will be erroneously inserted and cause
problems:

::: {#cb30 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
//Ensure curly braces open on the first line of a statement
return {
    status: true    //for example
};
//instead of
return
{
    status:true
};
```
:::

### Reserved Words

Most JavaScript reserved words are not used in the language but **cannot
be used to name variables or parameters**.

If used as the key in object literals, they *must* be quoted. For
example `object - {'case' : value};` or `object['final'] = value;` as
*case* and *final* are both reserved words.

### Unicode

JavaScript characters are 16 bits which only cover the original Unicode
Basic Multilingual Place.

### typeof

Watch out for: \* `typeof null` which returns 'object' instead of 'null'
\* incorrect reporting on typeof regular expressions, with some
implementations returning 'object' and some returning 'function' \*
arrays are objects in JavaScript so `typeof array` will return 'object'

All `object`s are *truthy* and `null` is *falsy*, so you can use the
following to tell them apart:

::: {#cb31 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
if (my_value && typeof my_value === 'object') {
    //then my value is definitely an object or an array because not only is its 'typeof' an object but it's also truthy (first statement)
}
```
:::

### NaN

-   `typeof NaN === 'number'` even though it stands for *not-a-number*
-   If you have a chain of formulas that together produce a `NaN` then
    at least *one* of them will have generated `NaN`
-   Surprisingly `NaN !=== NaN`
-   `isNaN(value)` can be used to distinguish numbers from NaN

For numbers, best use your own isNumber formula:

::: {#cb32 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
var isNumber = function isNumber(value) {
    return typeof value === 'number' && isFinite(value);    //isFinite() rejects NaN and Infinity, but is only good for numbers, not strings
}
```
:::

### Phony Arrays

JavaScript **doesn't have real arrays**, it has *array-like objects*.

-   Good: No need to give them dimensions and don't generate
    out-of-bounds errors
-   Bad: Slower than 'real' arrays

To test if value is an array:

::: {#cb33 .sourceCode}
``` {.sourceCode .javascript}
if (my_value && typeof my_value === 'object' && typeof my_value.length === 'number' &&
    !(my_value.propertyIsEnumerable('length'))) {
        //my_value is definitely an array!
}
```
:::

The `arguments` array isn't an array, just an object with a length
property.

### Falsy Values

`0`, `NaN`, `''`, `false`, `null` and `undefined` are all *falsy*
values, but **they are not interchangeable**. When testing for a missing
member of an object for example, you need to use `undefined` and not
`null`.

`undefined` and `NaN` are actually global variables instead of constants
but **don't change their values**.

### Object

JavaScript objects inherit members from the prototype chain so they are
*never truly empty*.

To test for membership without prototype chain involvement, use the
`hasOwnProperty` method or limit your results (for example, to specific
types like number so you know you're not dragging in object members from
up the prototype for example if that's what's causing the problem).

[]{#AppendixB} Appendix B - the Bad Parts
-----------------------------------------

**Avoid these altogether**

-   `==` **and** `!=`: Don't function properly when result is false, use
    `===` or `!==` instead
-   `with` **statement**: Intended to provide a shortcut to properties
    of an object but results vary every time it is run
-   `eval`: Adds unnecessary complication and compromises the security
    of the application
    -   Giving string arguments to `setTimeout` and `setInterval` should
        also be avoided as this makes them act like `eval`
-   `continue` **statement**: Forces a loop into its next iteration but
    the code is usually much improved when re-written *without*
    `continue`
-   `switch` **fall through**: In a `switch` statement, each `case`
    falls through to the next `case` unless you explicitly disrupt the
    flow, but using these *intentional* fall throughs makes the
    *unintentional* ones that are causing errors basically impossible to
    find
    -   This is one of those parts of JavaScript that appears useful but
        you're better off avoiding because it's occasionally very
        dangerous
-   **Block-less statements**: *Always* use curly braces `{}` to block
    in statements so as to avoid misinterpretation and aid error finding
-   **Bitwise operators**: Shouldn't really be doing this kind of
    manipulations because they are quite slow in JavaScript, therefore
    there shouldn't be a need to use `&`, `|`, `Ë`, `Ë`, `>>`, `>>>` or
    `<<`
    -   This doesn't mean you can't use `&&` for example
-   `++` **and** `--`: This one seems debatable to me; Douglas Crockford
    finds it makes his coding style much more cryptic and difficult to
    read (the book uses `+=1` and `-=1` instead)

**The function statement vs the function expression:** To use JavaScript
well, important to understand that **functions are values**. \* A
function *statement* is shorthand for a var statement with a function
value, so `function foo() {}` (a function statement) means pretty much
the same as `var foo = function foo(){};` (a function expression) \*
Logically, to write the language well you should define a function
before using it, but in JavaScript, function statements (using just
`function foo(){}`) are *hoisted* to the top of the scope in which they
are defined - this encourages sloppy programming and should be avoided
\* function statements also don't function consistently in `if`
statements \* if you need to start a function expression with the word
*function*, **wrap it in parentheses** (), or JavaScript assumes it's a
function *statement*

**Typed wrappers:** **Don't use `new Boolean` or `new String` or
`new Number`**, it's completely unnecessary. Also avoid `new Object` and
`new Array` and use `{}` and `[]` instead.

**[]{#new}`new` operator:** Functions that are intended to be used with
`new` (conventionally starting with a capital letter) should be avoided
(don't define them) as they can cause all kinds of issues and complex
bugs which are difficult to catch.

**void**: In JavaScript, this actually *takes* a value and *returns*
`undefined`, which is hugely confusing and not helpful. **Don't use
it**.

[]{#AppendixC} Appendix C - JSLint
----------------------------------

JSLint is a **code quality tool** for JavaScript which checks your
syntax.

Having read through this appendix (you can read more about [JSLint
here](http://www.jslint.com)), I tend more towards
[***JSHint***](http://jshint.com/about/), a *fork* of JSLint. It allows
programmers to customise for themselves which the good parts and bad
parts are and define their own subset, although naturally there are a
number of pre-defined options. [This is a really fantastic article on
using JSHint](https://github.com/nelsonic/learn-jshint); it's simple and
aimed at having you using JSHint in a few minutes as well as providing
various sources for pre-defined subsets.
