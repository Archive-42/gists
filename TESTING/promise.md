## intro

A Promise is a programming construct that can reduce some of the pains of asynchronous programming. Using Promises can help produce code that is leaner, easier to maintain, and easier to build on.

This lesson will mostly focus on ES6 Promise syntax, but will use [Bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird) since it provides excellent error handling in the browser. The CommonJS syntax will need a bundler like [browserify](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify) or [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/). See [jam3-lesson-module-basics](https://github.com/Jam3/jam3-lesson-module-basics) for an introduction to CommonJS and browserify.

## the problem

To demonstrate, let's take the problem of loading images in the browser. The following shows an implementation using a Node style (error-first) callback:

```javascript
function loadImage(url, callback) {
  var image = new Image();

  image.onload = function() {
    callback(null, image);
  };

  image.onerror = function() {
    callback(new Error('Could not load image at ' + url));
  };

  image.src = url;
}
```

<sub>*Tip:* The above is implemented on npm as [img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/img).</sub>

Loading a single image is relatively easy, and looks like this:

```js
loadImage('one.png', function(err, image) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('Image loaded', image);
});
```

However, as our application grows in complexity, so too does the code. If we were to take the same approach, but load three images, things get a little unwieldy:

```js
loadImage('one.png', function(err, image1) {
  if (err) throw err;

  loadImage('two.png', function(err, image2) {
    if (err) throw err;

    loadImage('three.png', function(err, image3) {
      if (err) throw err;

      var images = [image1, image2, image3];
      console.log('All images loaded', images);
    });
  });
});
```

This tends to create a "Christmas Tree" of functions; and leads to code that is difficult to read and maintain. Further, if we wanted the images to load in parallel, it would need a [more complex solution](https://gist.github.com/mattdesl/7b2afa86481fbce87098). 

## async

There are numerous abstractions built around the error-first callbacks, sometimes called "errbacks."

One way to solve the problem is with the [async](https://github.com/caolan/async) module:

```js
var mapAsync = require('async').map;

var urls = [ 'one.png', 'two.png' ];
mapAsync(urls, loadImage, function(err, images) {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('All images loaded', images);
});
```

Similar abstractions exist independently on npm, such as:

- [async-each](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-each)
- [async-each-series](https://www.npmjs.com/package/async-each-series)
- [run-series](https://www.npmjs.com/package/run-series)
- [run-waterfall](https://www.npmjs.com/package/run-waterfall)
- [map-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/map-limit)

This approach is very powerful. It's [a great fit for small modules](#promises-in-small-modules) as it does not introduce additional bloat or vendor lock-in, and does not have some of the other [pitfalls of promises](#pitfalls).

However, in a larger scope, promises can provide a unified and composable structure throughout your application. They will also lay the groundwork for [ES7 async/await](https://jakearchibald.com/2014/es7-async-functions/).

## promises

Let's re-implement the above with promises for our control flow. At first this may seem like more overhead, but the benefits will become clear shortly.

### `new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { ... })`

Below is how the image loading function would be implemented with promises. We'll call it `loadImageAsync` to distinguish it from the earlier example.

```js
var Promise = require('bluebird')

function loadImageAsync(url) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    var image = new Image();

    image.onload = function() {
      resolve(image);
    };

    image.onerror = function() {
      reject(new Error('Could not load image at ' + url));
    };

    image.src = url;
  });
}
```

The function returns a new instance of `Promise` which is *resolved* to `image` if the load succeeds, or *rejected* with a new `Error` if it fails. In our case, we `require('bluebird')` for the Promise implementation.

The `Promise` constructor is typically only needed for edge cases like this, where we are converting a callback-style API into a promise-style API. In many cases it is preferable to use a `promisify` or `denodeify` utility which converts Node style (error-first) functions into their `Promise` counterpart.

For example, the above becomes very concise with our [earlier `loadImage`](#the-problem) function:

```js
var Promise = require('bluebird');
var loadImageAsync = Promise.promisify(loadImage);
```

Or with the [img](https://www.npmjs.com/package/img) module:

```js
var Promise = require('bluebird');
var loadImage = require('img');
var loadImageAsync = Promise.promisify(loadImage);
```

If you aren't using Bluebird, you can use [es6-denodeify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-denodeify) for this.

### `.then(resolved, rejected)`

Each `Promise` instance has a `then()` method on its prototype. This allows us to handle the result of the async task.

```js
loadImageAsync('one.png')
  .then(function(image) {
    console.log('Image loaded', image);
  }, function(err) {
    console.error('Error loading image', err);
  });
```

`then` takes two functions, either of which can be `null` or undefined. The `resolved` callback is called when the promise succeeds, and it is passed the resolved value (in this case `image`). The `rejected` callback is called when the promise fails, and it is passed the `Error` object we created earlier.

### `.catch(err)`

Promises also have a `.catch(func)` to handle errors, which is the same as `.then(null, func)` but provides clearer intent.

```js
loadImageAsync('one.png')
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error('Could not load image', err);
  });
```

### chaining

The `.then()` method *always returns a Promise*, which means it can be chained. The above could be re-written like so. If a promise is rejected, the next `catch()` or `then(null, rejected)` will be called.

In the following example, if the `loadImageAsync` method is rejected, the only output to the console will be the error message.

```js
loadImageAsync('one.png')
  .then(function(image) {
    console.log('Image loaded', image);
    return { width: image.width, height: image.height };
  })
  .then(function(size) {
    console.log('Image size:', size);
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error('Error in promise chain', err);
  });
```

In general, you should be wary of long promise chains. They can be difficult to maintain and it would be better to split the tasks into smaller, named functions.

### resolving values

Your `then()` and `catch()` callbacks can return a value to pass it along to the next method in the chain. For example, here we resolve errors to a default image:

```js
loadImageAsync('one.png')
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.warn(err.message);
    return notFoundImage;
  })
  .then(function(image) {
    console.log('Resolved image', image);
  });
```

The above code will try to load `'one.png'`, but will fall back to using `notFoundImage` if the load failed. 

The cool thing is, you can return a `Promise` instance, and it will be resolved before the next `.then()` is triggered. The value resolved by that promise will also get passed to the next `.then()`.

```js
loadImageAsync('one.png')
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.warn(err.message);
    return loadImageAsync('not-found.png');
  })
  .then(function(image) {
    console.log('Resolved image', image);
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error('Could not load any images', err);
  });
```

The above tries to load `'one.png'`, but if that fails it will then load `'not-found.png'`.

### `Promise.all()`

Let's go back to our original task of loading multiple images.

The `Promise.all()` method accepts an array of values or promises and returns a new `Promise` that is only resolved once *all* the promises are resolved. Here we map each URL to a new Promise using `loadImageAsync`, and then pass those promises to `all()`.

```js
var urls = ['one.png', 'two.png', 'three.png'];
var promises = urls.map(loadImageAsync);

Promise.all(promises)
  .then(function(images) {
    console.log('All images loaded', images);
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    console.error(err);
  });
```

Finally, things are starting to look a bit cleaner.

### passing the buck

You may still be wondering where promises improve on the `async` approach. The real benefits come from composing promises across your application.

We can "pass the buck" by making named functions that return promises, and let errors bubble upstream. The above code would look like this:

```js
function loadImages(urls) {
  var promises = urls.map(loadImageAsync);
  return Promise.all(promises);
}
```

A more complex example might look like this:

```js
function getUserImages(user) {
  return loadUserData(user)
    .then(function(userData) {
      return loadImages(userData.imageUrls);
    });
}

function showUserImages(user) {
  return getUserImages(user)
    .then(renderGallery)
    .catch(renderEmptyGallery);
}

showUserImages('mattdesl')
  .catch(function(err) {
    showError(err);
  });
```

### `throw` and implicit catch

If you `throw` inside your promise chain, the error will be impliticly caught by the underlying Promise implementation and treated as a call to `reject(err)`. 

In the following example, if the user has not activated their account, the promise will be rejected and the `showError` method will be called.

```js
loadUser()
  .then(function(user) {
    if (!user.activated) {
      throw new Error('user has not activated their account');
    }
    return showUserGallery(user);
  })
  .catch(function(err) {
    showError(err.message);
  });
```

This part of the specification is often viewed as a pitfall of promises. It conflates the semantics of error handling by combining syntax errors, programmer error (e.g. invalid parameters), and connection errors into the same logic. 

It leads to frustrations during browser development: you might lose debugger capabilities, stack traces, and source map details.

![debugging](http://i.imgur.com/Y6RH8ke.png)

For many developers, this is enough reason to eschew promises in favour of error-first callbacks and abstractions like [async](#async).

## common patterns

### memoization

We can use `.then()` on a promise even after the asynchronous task is long complete. For example, instead of always requesting the same `'not-found.png'` image, we can cache the result of the first request and just resolve to the same `Image` object.

```js
var notFound;

function getNotFoundImage() {
  if (notFound) {
    return notFound;
  }
  notFound = loadImageAsync('not-found.png');
  return notFound;
}
```

This is more useful for server requests, since the browser already has a caching layer in place for image loading.

### `Promise.resolve` / `Promise.reject`

The `Promise` class also provides a `resolve` and `reject` method. When called, these will return a new promise that resolves or rejects to the (optional) value given to them.

For example:

```js
var thumbnail = Promise.resolve(defaultThumbnail);

//query the DB
if (userLoggedIn) {
  thumbnail = loadUserThumbnail();
}

//add the image to the DOM when it's ready
thumbnail.then(function(image) {
  document.body.appendChild(image);
});
```

Here `loadUserThumbnail` returns a `Promise` that resolves to an image. With `Promise.resolve` we can treat `thumbnail` the same even if it doesn't involve a database query.

### handling user errors

Functions that return promises should *always* return promises, so the user does not need to wrap them in a `try/catch` block.

Instead of throwing errors on invalid user arguments, you should return a promise that rejects with an error. [Promise.reject()](#promiseresolve--promisereject) can be convenient here.

For example, using our earlier [`loadImageAsync`](#new-promise):

```js
function loadImageAsync(url) {
  if (typeof url !== 'string') {
    return Promise.reject(new TypeError('must specify a string'));
  }

  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    /* async code */
  });
}
```

Alternatively, you could use `throw` inside the promise function:

```js
function loadImageAsync(url) {
  return new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
    if (typeof url !== 'string') {
      throw new TypeError('must specify a string');
    }

    /* async code */
  });
}
```

See [here](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/promises-guide#always-return-promises) for details.

### `Promise` in ES2015

Although this guide uses [bluebird](https://github.com/petkaantonov/bluebird), it should work in any standard Promise implementation. For example, using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/#promises).

Some other implementations: 

- [pinkie-promise](https://github.com/floatdrop/pinkie-promise)
- [es6-promise](https://www.npmjs.com/package/es6-promise)

For example, in Node/browserify:

```js
// use native promise if it exists
// otherwise fall back to polyfill
var Promise = global.Promise || require('es6-promise').Promise;
```

## pitfalls

In addition to the the issues mentioned in [`throw` and implicit catch](#throw-and-implicit-catch), there are some other problems to keep in mind when choosing promises. Some developers choose not to use promises for these reasons.

### promises in small modules

One situation where promises are not yet a good fit is in small, self-contained [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) modules.

- Depending on `bluebird` or `es6-promise` is a form of vendor lock-in. It can be a problem for frontend developers, where bundle size is a constraint. 
- Expecting the native `Promise` (ES2015) constructor is also a problem, since it creates a peer dependency on these polyfills.
- Mixing different promise implementations across modules may lead to subtle bugs and debugging irks.

Until native Promise support is widespread, it is often easier to use Node-style callbacks and independent [async modules](#async) for control flow and smaller bundle size. 

Consumers can then "promisify" your API with their favourite implementation. For example, using the [xhr](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xhr) module in Bluebird might look like this: 

```js
var Promise = require('bluebird')
var xhrAsync = Promise.promisify(require('xhr'))
```

### complexity

Promises can introduce a lot of complexity and mental overhead into a codebase (evident by the need for this guide). In real-world projects, developers will often work with promise-based code without fully understanding how promises work.

See Nolan Lawson's ["We Have a Problem With Promises"](http://pouchdb.com/2015/05/18/we-have-a-problem-with-promises.html) for an example of this.

### lock-in

Another frustration is that promises tend to work best once *everything* in your codebase is using them. In practice, you might find yourself refactoring and "promisifying" a lot of code before you can reap the benefits of promises. It also means that new code must be written with promises in mind — you are now stuck with them!
