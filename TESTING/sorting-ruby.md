#SORTS
- Selection Sort: This algorithm works by examining a contiguous sublist of the original list. It finds the nth largest element in the list and swaps it with the nth element. It then examines n-1 terms. Selection sort runs in Î˜(n2) time for worst, bets, and average case scenarios.
- Bubblesort: This algorithm works by swapping consecutive elements that are unordered. It ex- amines two consecutive elements at a time. Bubblesort terminates when it completes an iteration through the list without swapping any elements. It runs in O(n2) time for average and worst cases, and O(n) time if the list is already sorted.
- Insertion Sort: This algorithm works by examining a larger contiguous subset of the original list on each iteration. On the first iteration, only elements at indices 0-1 are examined. If they are out of order, they are swapped. On the next iteration, elements at indices 0-2 are examined. The element at index 2 is pulled out of the list and compared against the preceding one-by-one while it is bigger than the given element. This process is repeated throughout the entire list. If the list is nearly sorted, then insertion sort runs in O(n) time. Otherwise, it runs in O(n2) time.
- Mergesort: This algorithm partitions the list into contiguous sublists until each sublist has at most two elements. These elements are swapped if necessary. The sublists are then merged into their parent sublists such that the elements are properly ordered. Mergesort runs in O(nlog(n)) time, and is an ideal sorting algorithm for both arrays and linked lists.
- Quicksort: This algorithm works to sort arrays by ordering elements around a partition point. Elements larger than the parttion go to the right of it, and elements smaller than the partition go to the left of it. Elements equal to the partition value can be placed on either side, as long as this is handled consistently. The subsets on either side of the partition are then recursively

evaluated until contiguous subsets of no more than two elements are evaluated.

# Sample implementation of quicksort and mergesort in ruby
Both algorithm sort in O(n * lg(n)) time
Quicksort works inplace, where mergesort works in a new array

```ruby
def quicksort(array, from=0, to=nil)
    if to == nil
        # Sort the whole array, by default
        to = array.count - 1
    end
 
    if from >= to
        # Done sorting
        return
    end
 
    # Take a pivot value, at the far left
    pivot = array[from]
 
    # Min and Max pointers
    min = from
    max = to
 
    # Current free slot
    free = min
 
    while min < max
        if free == min # Evaluate array[max]
            if array[max] <= pivot # Smaller than pivot, must move
                array[free] = array[max]
                min += 1
                free = max
            else
                max -= 1
            end
        elsif free == max # Evaluate array[min]
            if array[min] >= pivot # Bigger than pivot, must move
                array[free] = array[min]
                max -= 1
                free = min
            else
                min += 1
            end
        else
            raise "Inconsistent state"
        end
    end
 
    array[free] = pivot
 
    quicksort array, from, free - 1
    quicksort array, free + 1, to

#What Happens When You Type In A URL
```

browser checks cache; if requested object is in cache and is fresh, skip to #9
browser asks OS for server's IP address
OS makes a DNS lookup and replies the IP address to the browser
browser opens a TCP connection to server (this step is much more complex with HTTPS)
browser sends the HTTP request through TCP connection
browser receives HTTP response and may close the TCP connection, or reuse it for another request
browser checks if the response is a redirect (3xx result status codes), authorization request (401), error (4xx and 5xx), etc.; these are handled differently from normal responses (2xx)
if cacheable, response is stored in cache
browser decodes response (e.g. if it's gzipped)
browser determines what to do with response (e.g. is it a HTML page, is it an image, is it a sound clip?)
browser renders response, or offers a download dialog for unrecognized types
```
