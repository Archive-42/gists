Seeded Procedural Music Generator
---------------------------------
Procedural Generation allows you to create unique infiniteness that can be consistently reproduced. Enter seed data (your name is a great place to start) and hear a unique, infinite, and reproducible song.

Everything is notated in flats instead of sharps for simplicity sake.

Still has the occasional bug. If it doesnt play anything, refresh and try a new seed.
